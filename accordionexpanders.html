  <p>At the beginning of this year, I came into school optimistic and ready to do well. I was going to get all my homework done, do well on all my tests, and go to Cross Country every day after school.  I carried out all of these things. I did my homework, I did well on the tests, and I went to Cross Country every day (even though I never got much better at running).  Of course, doing so well and good, I had nowhere to go but down.  I got an A in every class I had first quarter, counting a few A- grades and the B+ in P.E. The next quarter, I did even better than before. My P.E. grade became an A, and my World History grade went up by a point. I had a B in Language Arts, but that's to be expected, as LA is one of my weaker subjects.
 Around this time, winter break rolled around. Things started going south as soon as the snow days hit. I hardly had to put up with any work at all, because of how much time off there was. At this point, Cross Country was over and I decided to take a break instead of doing Winter Training. I got used to sitting around at home all day, doing nothing more than playing Minecraft. When school finally started again, I began doing worse. I kept on ignoring assignments that I should have been doing, especially in World History. More was being expected from me, and my response was doing less. All of my grades (except for my science one, which I had heavy incentive to keep up) began to plummet. A's became B's, B's became C's. I was slipping, and I needed to come up with a new plan to prevent my bad grades from snowballing. So I did. I developed a plan so good it would allow me to remain relatively lazy while still keeping good grades. I'd simply ignore all previous work as though it had never existed to begin with, and complete all incoming assignments. Pay attention in class, and prioritize sleep over school work completion. It rescued my grades from further descension. By getting enough sleep, I'd be able to be productive and pay attention in class, so I'd at least be able to learn the material. Ignoring the old stuff would allow me to not feel overwhelmed to the point of having meltdowns every day.
This success, though, crumbled just like that which I had at the beginning of the year. There were assignments that we were given plenty of time to do. Like a fool, I got distracted away from many of these assignments by the temptations of sloth pictures on the internet. I wasted every day of a whole month sleeping, procrastinating, and more, instead of doing any work at all. My addiction to Minecraft at this point was crippling, and I was in denial. I was unable to take off my clouded glasses and see the truth, that I had to change. Now, even, I still fail to complete work. 
The piece of work I have chosen is my Crusades DBQ Notes, and the document below is an earlier version of before I did a lot more notes and finished the DBQ (lol I haven't finished the DBQ yet, I'll erase this message once I do).</p>
